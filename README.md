# Portfolio Projects

## ScribeGPT  
Inspired by my work in a clinical setting, this project focuses on streamlining the scribing process for healthcare professionals. **ScribeGPT** is a full-stack web application showcasing skills in:  
- **Frontend**: Designed a user-friendly interface to input and organize patient and provider notes.  
- **Backend**: Developed RESTful APIs to securely process and store patient data.  
- **ChatGPT API Integration**: Leveraged OpenAI's API to convert freeform text into structured clinical notes, improving workflow efficiency.  
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed the application using [deployment tools/platforms used, e.g., AWS, Heroku, etc.].  
This project highlights my ability to use real-world inspiration and technical expertise to build impactful solutions.

## Betting Calculator  
This project was both technically challenging and a fun exploration of integrating mathematics into software development. **Betting Calculator** is a web-based tool where:  
- **Frontend**: I built an intuitive UI to let users input odds, bet amounts, and calculate potential payouts dynamically.  
- **Backend**: Wrote the mathematical logic to compute accurate betting odds and payouts.  
- **Deployment**: Deployed the project online to ensure cross-platform accessibility.  
This project was particularly rewarding as I had to incorporate mathematical concepts into the code, overcoming challenges to ensure precision.

## Fantasy Football Project  
I thought a fun project would be visualizing how players perform in fantasy football relative to their projections. The unique part of this project was grouping players to analyze positional volatility and consistency. I:  
- Collected data manually in Excel and manipulated it.  
- Cleaned the data in Python and performed various analyses.  
- Documented everything in a Jupyter Notebook file in the repository.

## Traffic Sign Image Classifier  
This is a project I worked on during a Python course for my Master's degree. It uses a convolutional neural network to identify traffic signs. The notebook includes detailed explanations and walks through the process.

## Other Projects  
Some basic data-related projects I’ve worked on recently are also included in the repository. While the fantasy football project was entirely my own, these other projects were inspired by online tutorials to familiarize myself with tools like Tableau and SQL. Although my bandwidth is currently limited, I’d like to continue exploring these kinds of projects.

## Machine Learning Projects  
Two of the larger ML projects I’ve worked on include:  
1. An image classifier model used to detect street signs, completed for a school project.  
2. A U-Net model developed with a friend during my free time to identify contrails to reduce global warming. This was part of a Kaggle competition.

## YouTube, Kaggle, and ChatGPT Credit  
Some datasets and tutorials I’ve utilized come from YouTube and Kaggle, which often include example code for inspiration. ChatGPT has been extremely useful for explaining lines of code to ensure conceptual understanding, diagnosing errors, and offering recommendations to make code more efficient or detailed.
