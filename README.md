# PortfolioProjects

Just some basic data related projects I have tried out in the past few months. I have learned to create these using already existing code and learning how it works. However in my other repository names Fantas

## Machine Learning Projects

Two of the larger ML projects I have worked on include an image classifier model used to detect street signs, this was done for a school project. Then during my free time, I worked with my friend on a U-net model to identify plane contrials to reduce global warming, this was for a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-research-identify-contrails-reduce-global-warming). 

## Youtube, Kaggle, and ChatGPT credit

Some datasets and tutorials I have found through Youtube and Kaggle, they also have example code that I can learn from and use as inspiration for my own projects. ChatGPT has been extrememly useful for me, I mostly use it to explain how lines of code work to ensure that I understand everything conceptually, explaining errors, and sometimes even to provide recommendations to make code more efficient or detailed.
