# PortfolioProjects

## Fantasy football project

I thought a fun project would be visualizing how players do in fantasy football relative to their projections, the unique part to this would be grouping them, to see if some positions are more volitile, consistent, etc. I collected all of this data manually in excel where I did some manipulation. Then in python I cleaned it up and performed various analysis, this is all in the jupyter notebook file in the repository.

## Other Projects
Some other basic data related projects I have tried out in the past few months are also included here, while the fantasy football project I created on my own, some of these other projects I learned from others online, to familiarize myself with tools that I had less experience with, like Tableau and SQL.

## Machine Learning Projects

Two of the larger ML projects I have worked on include an image classifier model used to detect street signs, this was done for a school project. Then during my free time, I worked with my friend on a U-net model to identify plane contrials to reduce global warming, this was for a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-research-identify-contrails-reduce-global-warming). 

## Youtube, Kaggle, and ChatGPT credit

Some datasets and tutorials I have found through Youtube and Kaggle, they also have example code that I can learn from and use as inspiration for my own projects. ChatGPT has been extrememly useful for me, I mostly use it to explain how lines of code work to ensure that I understand everything conceptually, explaining errors, and sometimes even to provide recommendations to make code more efficient or detailed.
